# keylogger
A demo simple keylogger
It can capture all the key strokes that are pressed in the keyboard....
The captures key strokes will be saved in a text file namely dump.txt....
And whenever the key strokes will exceed 50, the program will automatically delete all the data present in the file(dump.txt)....
So that it doesn't occupy large space over time....
Hope you like it☺️
Thank you☺️
